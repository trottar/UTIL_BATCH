A repository of scripts to run some scripts using the farm. This is a collection of scripts that existed previously under UTIL_KAONLT.
I decided it's a little confusing to have them only under that repo though when they actually work for just about anything!

Folder structure as follows -

batch_scripts - Scripts that submit farm jobs
Analysis_Scripts - Some generic analysis scripts for running calibrations e.t.c.
InputRunLists - Lists of input runs for use submitting as farm jobs
